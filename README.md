This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Wishing safe travels to my burner family, some new - some longtime, returning to the default world from HOME. I'm so looking forward to any and all stories you care to share!

I found this beautiful 4 minute snapshot of BM 2018, which was my first since 2009. Such magical memories...

I didn't attend this year, but the insane last minute idea to attempt going started a whirlwind magic carpet ride as I helped many (almost orphans) make it HOME! Many for the very first time! I'll be posting more details as I decompress. So needless to say how off the charts rewarding this experience was!!

I'm bursting at the seems with gratitude while having THE BEST WEEK OF MY LIFE!!


It almost seems blasphemous to say this, but I'm so glad I didn't go to Burning Man because as amazing as I know it would've been, it would be ludicrous to think that it could've been half as good as it was.

Fuck our 2020 burns!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

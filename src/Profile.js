            <p>Hi! My name is Alan Triacca and I am a full stack software developer based in Utah.</p>
            {/* <br></br> */}
            <p>I'm just as passionate about making things as I am with improving everything I see and just finding ways to make the planet a better place for everyone.</p>
            <p>After graduating from the University of Connecticut, I spent more than ten years with two different companies. First in the semiconductor industry, mostly as an Applications Engineer and Account Manager. Then in investor education, as a Client Service/Technical Support specialist.</p>
            <p>I completed the Full Stack JavaScript Web Development Bootcamp at V School in Salt Lake City on May 17, 2019. I'm very excited to embark on my new career!</p>

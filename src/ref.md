You are going to build your portfolio website.

Project Requirements
Must be deployed LIVE on the web (We recommend Surge for deploying static sites).
Prominently displays your name
Have a link that allows people to view and/or download your resume
Have links to your Linkedin and Github profiles
Have your contact information (phone and/or email address)
Have a Projects section/page:
Each project has a name, description, a screenshot (optional), and a link to the live version so they can test it out. (We'll cover deployment in later class.)
Must be nicely laid out and responsive.
You can use any web development technologies you'd like. You may use, but are not limited to, React, although since it is likely going to just be a static website, you may decide that using React is a bit overkill. Either way, as long as you satisfy the requirements, it really doesn't matter.

Design Advice
Start with something very basic. Don't go out of your way to come up with an extravagant design from the beginning. Displaying the important information is the primary goal of this project.

Here's the right and wrong way to do a Minimum Viable Product:



Get something that's passable â€” well-designed, minimal, and contains the important information. Then build on top of it as you see fit.

Dos and don'ts:
Do:

Use a nice font that is subtle and classy. Something like Roboto from Google Fonts
Take the edge off the stark white background by changing the color to something subtle and neutral, like a very very light gray (See the "whitesmoke" CSS color for an example)
Take the edge off the sharp black text by lightening it a bit, like a very very dark gray.
Use very subtle transitions if you decide to include them. Nothing should be jarring or move a whole lot on the page
Stick to one or two fonts at most
List the languages and technologies you've used (JavaScript, React, Redux, Git, JSON Web Tokens, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, HTML Canvas, etc.)
Don't:

Use a silly, childish, busy, or unprofessional font.
Use sharp or heavily-contrasted colors.
Use multiple font families in the same type of text. (Different fonts for different paragraphs, i.e.)
At most, have one font family for headers and another for paragraph text
Put long paragraphs. No one will read them.
Tell your story of being a total beginner programmer or your journey that led you to want to code.
Put a chart indicating your level of proficiency in a given language or technology (80% in CSS, 85% in JavaScript, etc.).
List the editor or IDE you use.
General Advice:
Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you necessarily should. (Crazy animations, jarring transitions, bright colors, confusing or busy video backgrounds, etc.)
Keep your portfolio simple. Unless you're applying for a job as a web designer and want to show off your abilities, people will want to be able to glean information about you as quickly as possible, like a resume. Don't make them click through a bunch of menus to find the info they're really looking for: your past experience and examples of your code.
Good Examples:

https://xandroxygen.github.io/ (Except for the charts at the bottom)
http://michaelalves.me/ (Probably more designed than you should worry about, but might give you some good ideas)
